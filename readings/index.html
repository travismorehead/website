<div class="one">
  <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">What is Code</a><br><br>
  -Made me truly reflect on the omnipresence of software and what we have come to take for granted at this point.<br><br>
  -"Disruption is just optimization by another name." (towards the bottom of article?) Optimization implies a consolidation (money/labor/power). So in this case, disruption comes at the expense of the many. The presumptuous pro-capitalist undertones throughout this article bother me, but it is Bloomberg.</p><br>

  -I think "behavior" (somewhere about 3/4 of the way in) can have aesthetic qualities too, or rather, aesthetics can also contain function. Functionality in this context extends the world of metaphor beyond static symbol and into temporal action as well. The transitional space between states still relies on what's at either end.<br><br>
  -Reference to "a language of transformation" reminds me of the indeterminate scoring techniques devised by artist like John Cage and Morton Feldman&mdash; instructions that can incorporate variable conditions so that the same thing can play out in multiples ways depending on the who/what/where/when involved. An analog precursor/parallel to software.<br><br>
  -The essay reminded me of Vilém Flusser's book, "Towards a Philosophy of Photography," where one of his ideas is that to expand an understanding of what a tool's parameters are (/can be) requires it to be used in ways that defy convention&mdash; actions that point back to the capacity of the tool itself have the ability to reveal latent characteristics.</p><br>

<div class="three">
  <p><a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/" target="_blank">Jodi's Infrastructure</a><br><br>
  I feel like whether content or context is the maker's focus, both are always present to varying degrees regardless of intent. If only subconsciously, content is shaped by its conditions of making, and even self-referential context is voiceless without something to speak through. In the case of Jody's work, something was needed to illustrate the infrastructure's qualities. Every choice made carries potential significance, and I don't think content is ever entirely negligible. When looking at the css on some of the Jody pages, they took the time to style the text. Also the projects that automatically refresh the page made it super hard to inspect the code, which was interesting.</p><br>

<div class="four">
<p><a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/" target="_blank">Vernacular Web 1
</a><br><br>
  Made me consider how ephemeral the digital landscape is, and the ease in which it can be re-written. I remember the aesthetics Olia describes, but it's interesting how little I consider these changes without prompting. There's a definite cultural amnesia that takes place when there isn't much of a record to be had.</p><br>
</div>
<div class="five">
  <p><a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/google-facebook-informational-capitalism/" target="_blank">Capitalism vs. Privacy</a><br><br>
  This article makes me think of so many things, like capitalism's innate ability to commodify anything/everything. As long as there is societal interest, then there's opportunity to be had. It's also interesting to think about how information capitalism still primarily exists as a middleman for tangible goods and services. Without the desire for ever-refined targeted advertising, personal data wouldn't be as valuable as it is. I love this quote: "Informational capitalism ultimately wishes to 'produce tractable, predictable citizen-consumers whose preferred modes of self-determination play out along predictable and profit-generating trajectories.'” I always wonder what the end-goal of corporations are. If business success is predicated on sustained growth, how does that model fit into intrinsically finite systems? Especially when applied to data collection + behavior modification.</p><br>

<div class="six">
  <p><a href="http://internet-atlas.net/" target="_blank">Critical Atlas of Internet</a><br><br>
  I love the exercise of imagining the shape of the internet. Attempting to give visual form helps the mind contend with a system that is opaque and abstract. I like the animated one depicted how search engines pull topology from an otherwise level surface, and the one illustrating major content providers working like stalactites.

  <p><a href="http://newclues.cluetrain.com/" target="_blank">New Clues</a><br><br>
  Some statement stand outs:<br><br>
  12. "There has not been a tool with such a general purpose since language."<br>
  -I like this idea of the web as a vessel for communication, with its expression derived from how we imagine it to be.<br><br>
  70. "Web pages are about connecting. Apps are about control."<br>
  -This one really resonates. I feel like it sums up a lot of issues I've been thinking about lately in relation to my own internet use, and the reason why I find myself spending less and less time participating in social media apps. Also makes me think of some of the alternative platform models that people are developing in response, like are.na.<br><br>
  32. "The Web remakes the world in our collective, emergent image."<br>
  -A healthy collective requires universal access, so this statement makes me question what voices are present online. As an extension of our social fabric, it also makes me consider the ethics of corporate gatekeepers controlling access to the internet. Why is it not a public utility? Why hasn't there been government investment in providing the infrastructure for high-speed internet like water or electricity?</p>
